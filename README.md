# gmail-hold
Gmail add-on that allows you to hold your incoming email until you are ready to process it

## How it Works (installation details below)
- Files must be copied to Google Scripts and then installed as a test deployment by your Google user 
- You will also need to create a filter that automatically moves all incoming email to a hidden Gmail label
- This add-on then moves those messages out of the hidden Gmail label and into your inbox

## Settings and Features
- Choose how many times you would like to release your email into your inbox (between 1-8 per day)
- Optionally require that your inbox be empty (Inbox Zero) before you can release email (regardless of remaining release count)
- Optionally enable "Impulse Control" which limits your ability to change settings if limits have been reached

## Installation
1. Go to [Google Apps Scripts](https://script.google.com/home)
2. Click 'New project'
3. Click 3 vertical dots next to Code.gs in left side menu
4. Select 'Delete' and confirm deletion
